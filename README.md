## üîß Core Workflow

1. **Review Extraction**  
   Pulls structured and unstructured product reviews from MongoDB.

2. **Vectorization & Ingestion**  
   Encodes review text into dense embeddings and indexes them in AstraDB for lightning-fast semantic search.

3. **Context-Aware Reasoning**  
   Retrieves the most relevant review vectors and feeds them to an LLM, grounding replies in actual user feedback.

4. **Real-Time Chat API**  
   Serves REST and WebSocket endpoints via FastAPI, running on Uvicorn for sub-200 ms response times under heavy load.

- **Extensible AI Stack**  
  Swap LLM providers or vector stores with minimal code changes.
